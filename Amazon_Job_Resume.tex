	\begin{itemize*}
		\item I am currently a Software Development Engineer  III  and tech lead of AWS IoT  (Internet of Things) \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-rules.html}{Rules Engine team} (a managed cloud service that lets connected IoT devices transform and send data to AWS and other cloud services/ingestion points). 
		\item Rules Engine  is a high scale Java/Scala based EC2 micro services distributed system built using CFN/CDK on top of Akka Streams  that transforms messages with a custom interpreter and routes petabytes of data yearly into AWS Systems like S3, DynamoDB, Kinesis, SQS, SNS, Cloudwatch, ElasticSearch, Lambda. Timestream etc and  also custom systems like Kafka and generic HTTP Servers. 
		\item My job duties include orchestrating/coordinating back end architectural design, product direction with stakeholders (technical and project management), operational excellence, software implementation, mentoring  and coaching junior engineers.  Notable projects I worked on
		\begin{itemize*}
			\item I lead the design, implementation and testing effort for \href{https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/12/aws-iot-core-rules-engine-google-protocol-buffer-messaging-format/}{Google protobuf format support} for AWS IoT core ingestion.
			\item I coordinated and led the effort for org wide improvements in high scale load testing (including writing the standard guidelines/template for it), investigating and implementing resiliency improvements for slow/misbehaving downstream ingestion which consume more client resources (threads/CPU etc)

		\item  I was a Software Development Engineer II in AWS IoT  Rules Engine team and  AWS RDS Aurora Serverless team (a cloud service that provisions and maintains Relational Databases in AWS Cloud). Notable projects I worked on
		\begin{itemize*}
			\item  I led/designed/implemented low cost ingestion into AWS  IoT Core with \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-basic-ingest.html}{Basic Ingest}. The project involved simplifying ingestion and reduction of per message costs by 70 percent (from 1 dollar to 30 cents per million messages)
			\item I led a cost reduction effort in AWS IoT Core, finding opportunities in low cost logging, infra usage and internal messaging costs, which led to an infrastructure cost reduction by 55 percent.
			\item I was part of the team that implemented \href{https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/12/introducing-the-next-version-of-amazon-aurora-serverless-in-preview/}{RDS Aurora Serverless V2}, a dynamically auto scaling managed relational database solution, in which my notable contribution was creating infrastructure management for EC2 hosts and firecracker VMs on which databases were hosted.
